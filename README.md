Face Recognition Door Lock System with Wi-Fi Module
This project implements a face recognition-based door lock system using a Wi-Fi module. The system utilizes facial recognition to identify authorized users and, upon successful identification, unlocks the door. The entire system is built using C and C++ programming languages.

Features
Face Recognition: Uses an image capturing module to recognize faces and match them against a pre-trained database.

Wi-Fi Integration: The Wi-Fi module (e.g., ESP8266/ESP32) is used to remotely control and interact with the lock system.

Secure Door Locking: Upon successful recognition, the system sends a signal to unlock the door.

Real-Time Monitoring: The system provides feedback and updates on the recognition status.

Components Used
Microcontroller: (e.g., Arduino, ESP32, etc.)

Camera Module: Used for capturing images for face recognition (e.g., OV7670, or compatible camera module).

Wi-Fi Module: ESP8266/ESP32 (for Wi-Fi communication).

Servo Motor: For physically unlocking the door.

Face Recognition Software: Built using OpenCV or similar library for facial recognition.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Before running the system, make sure you have the following installed:

Arduino IDE (or any other compatible IDE)

OpenCV (for face recognition if you're using a PC for processing)

ESP8266/ESP32 Libraries (for communication between the microcontroller and Wi-Fi module)

Servo Motor Library (for controlling the lock)

Hardware Setup
Microcontroller: Connect the ESP32 or Arduino to your computer using a USB cable.

Camera Module: Connect the camera module to the appropriate pins on the microcontroller.

Servo Motor: Wire the servo motor to control the door lock.

Wi-Fi Module: If using ESP8266, connect it to the microcontroller for internet access and communication.

Software Setup
Clone this repository to your local machine.

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/face-recognition-door-lock.git
cd face-recognition-door-lock
Open the Arduino IDE (or your preferred IDE) and load the appropriate code from the src folder onto your microcontroller.

Ensure that the libraries for the ESP32/ESP8266 and OpenCV (if required) are properly installed.

Configure the Wi-Fi settings in the code, inputting your network credentials (SSID and Password).

Train the facial recognition model (if applicable) and ensure the system can detect faces and match them correctly.

Upload the code to the microcontroller.

Running the System
Once the system is set up:

Power on the system, and the Wi-Fi module should connect to the configured network.

The camera module will start capturing images and perform face recognition.

If an authorized face is detected, the servo motor will be triggered to unlock the door.

Control via Wi-Fi
Use any compatible mobile app or web interface to control and monitor the door lock system via the Wi-Fi module.

The system can also send status updates over Wi-Fi for remote monitoring.
